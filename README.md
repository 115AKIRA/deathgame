# Deathgame

Link to online documentation : https://115akira.github.io/deathgame-documentation/

__Deathgame__ is an online app inspired by Brantsteele's Hunger Games simulator and Orteil's Murder Games. 
The goal of this project is to make a game with the ability to edit scenarios like the Hunger Game Simulator, while also having lots of options for the participants like in Murder Games.
Data management is an important part of this project, using .JSON files to store the scenarios and using JavaScript sessions to keep track of selected options.

## Current progress of the project :
* Disclaimer and Homepage : Mostly operational (Can set up the options and games to play, though lacking the ability to import a scenario)
* Scenario editing : Completely operational (Can modify the contestants and events using a base scenario as a template and export your modified scenario)
* Game : WIP
